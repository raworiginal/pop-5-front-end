## About The App

Bleepr is a retro social media app, an homage to early twitter and myspace. Bleeprs can create bleeps, read other Bleeprs bleeps, edit their own bleeps, and delete their own bleeps. Additionally Bleeprs, can comment on bleeps and edit and delete those comments.

Bleeprs can also filter bleeps based on Hashtags.

Bleeprs also have a profile page with an about me sections, and bleeprs can edit that about me section.

We built this project because we miss the sense of discovery and engagement that came with social media before algorithmically generated feeds.

## Next Steps (WIP)

While working on this project with pushed against the limits of MongoDB in a social media project. Specifically when it came to adding Friends to our Bleepr pages. So in our next iteration of Bleepr, we will migrate from MongoDb to a relational database like PostgresSQL.

We would like to add functionality like add and remove friends, and having a Top 8 list.

We would like to allow users to upload profile pictures.
