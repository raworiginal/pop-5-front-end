## About The App

Pop 5 is a social ranking app, where users create topics and add their Top 5 list to the topics. You can also browse most recent topics and add your top 5 to those lists. You can create, read, update, and delete lists. You can also update your topics. When you make your top 5, you can search an api for the metadata for the movies in your top 5 and rearrange the order of your list.
